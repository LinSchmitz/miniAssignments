Here's a complete and clean **README.md** for your **TODO List** project:

---

# ✅ TODO List App

A simple and elegant TODO List application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)**. This app allows users to add tasks and view their current task list. It uses modern best practices such as module imports and scoped styling.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add new TODO items with a title
- Auto-focus and clear input after adding
- Structured and accessible HTML
- Responsive layout using CSS
- Modular JavaScript with ES Modules

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom styling with Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (ES6+ with modules)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
project/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── main.css
├── src/
│   └── js/
│       └── main.js
```

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User enters a title in the input field.
2. Pressing the "+" button submits the form and adds the item.
3. The item is rendered inside the `div.items` section.
4. The form input is reset automatically after submission.

## ✨ Sample HTML Markup

```html
<form>
  <h3>Add Items</h3>
  <input type="text" id="title" placeholder="Title" />
  <button>+</button>
</form>
<div class="items">
  <h3>My Items</h3>
</div>
```
